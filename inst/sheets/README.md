Notes on where these sheets came from.

exp.xlsx: GitHub <https://github.com/hadley/readxl/issues/163>. OP [wrathematics](https://github.com/wrathematics) says data "was generated by and exported from JMP". Commenter [nacnudus](https://github.com/nacnudus) notes that "The cells don't have the `r` attribute that gives the cell address."

Ekaterinburg_IP_9.xlsx: GitHub <https://github.com/hadley/readxl/issues/80>. OP said:

> readxl version 0.1.0
> There is a problem with reading some xlsx files (not the ones generated by Google Docs - this is some other xlsx generating BI) please try the following:

        download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e-kotov/tmp/master/Ekaterinburg_IP_9.xlsx",
                      method = "curl", dest = "Ekaterinburg_IP_9.xlsx")
        x <- read_excel("Ekaterinburg_IP_9.xlsx", skip = 5)

> It returns " Error: Couldn't find 'xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml'". As soon as the file in question is opened in Excel and re-saved, it is loaded with no problem.

Jenny used the above to download the original file (included here w/ OP's permission), then opened in Excel and did Save As .... to create
`inst/sheets/Ekaterinburg_IP_9-RESAVED.xlsx` in order to compare the underlying XML.
