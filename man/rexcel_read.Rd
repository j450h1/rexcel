\title{Read an xlsx file that probably contains nontabular data}
\usage{
rexcel_read(path, sheet = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to the xlsx file to load.  xls files are not supported.}

\item{sheet}{Sheet number (not name at this point).  Googlesheets
exported sheets are likely not to do the right thing.}
}
\value{
An \code{xlsx} object that can be printed.  Future methods
  might do something sensible.  The structure is subject to
  complete change so is not documented here.
}
\description{
This function does not get the data into a usable form but at
least loads it up into R so we can poke about with it.  The
resulting loaded data can distinguish between formulae and data,
numbers and text.  Merged cells are detected.  Style information
is included, though nothing is done with it yet.  A summary of the
data is printed if you print the resulting object.
